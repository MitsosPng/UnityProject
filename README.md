# UnityProject
A group project that was developed as a university assignment in combination with the courses "Virtual Reality" and "IT Development Technologies Game".

The subject of the work was to create a 2D or 3D game using the Unity 3D platform. We created a 3D third person game with the
camera to follow the player. Our player takes on the role of a pirate in a world inspired by the movie "Pirates of the Caribbean" about it and the npcs that have
used are lords, guards, pirates but also ordinary people. The player is asked to complete some missions (quests) and also to fight some enemies. The enemies in particular are skeletons. 
Our map includes 3 villages each with separate missions but also two islands that belong to the pirates and the player can be transported to them by driving a ship as its captain.

 **Group members involved in this project:**<br>
 Athanasios Bitakis, Dimitrios Panagiotopoulos, Avgerinos Christos.
